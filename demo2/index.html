            About the Sport
        </h2>
        <p>
            Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, 
            with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat.
            A run is scored when a runner crosses home plate.

        <h2>My Experience with Baseball</h2>
        <p>
            I played baseball for most of my life from when I was in t-ball all the way up into high school. I played rec ball, travel ball, and school ball. It was always one of
            my favorite sports to play and I always love watching it as well.
