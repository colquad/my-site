            <h3>Designing Navigation</h3>
            <p>This is a website for a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
            <p>It has a clear navigation bar that is consistent throughout all pages, and you can very easily tell where each selection will take you.</p>
            <p>If you want to see the menu there is a very clear button to click for that, and if you want to place an online order there is a clear button for that.</p>

            <h3>The Importance of Getting People Off on the Right Foot</h3>
            <p>This is a website for a company that sells solar systems, roofing, and water purification systems.</p>
            <p>The home page tells you exactly that right off the bat, and also shows their mission statement.</p>
            <p>There are also enticing wording like saving money, and you can also easily get a consultation.</p>

            <h3>Create Effective Visual Hierarchies</h3>
            <p>Zillow starts with a simple home page, introducing users to its brand, and gradually reveals more complex features and tools to help find homes.</p>
            <p>The site combines a traditional grid structure with clear visuals and easy navigation, continually refining its offerings.</p>

            <h3>Designing for Scanning Not Reading</h3>
            <p>Pardon its French but this website is purposefully made to have awful design.</p>
            <p>This rule not only breaks every convention out there, but it also has way too many distractions and things on the page that take away from the user's experience.</p>
            <p>The cursor is an ugly icon, there are misspelled words, there are a lot of moving parts, and the many different obscure backgrounds make it hard to look at.</p>

            <h3>Krug's First Law of Usability (Don't Make Me Think)</h3>
            <p>This website doesn't have much in it but there is one thing that pops out at me right away.</p>
            <p>There is a green button that says "NO" and text under it that says "Please click HERE to GO to the next page".</p>
            <p>Now my first thought would be that I should click the big green button to go somewhere but it also says no. As well as that weird button, the text underneath has weird formatting that also makes the user confused on where to actually click.</p>
            <p>It turns out the big button, underlined word, and the words with different text are not what you are supposed to click. You are supposed to click "HERE", which may seem obvious, but it's very annoying UI.</p>

            <h3>Make It Obvious Whatâ€™s Clickable</h3>
            <p>You easily get lost in this disgusting UI. I look around and I have no idea where on the page I even am.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of things to click on, but none of them are very obvious. You also have no idea what will happen when you click on them.</p>
