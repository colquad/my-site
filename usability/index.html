    <h1>Usability Test Results</h1><br>
    
    <h2><u>Website that was tested</u></h2>
    <h3><a href="/collectapp/login.html">Book Collection App</a></h3><br>
    
    <h2><u>User Demographics</u></h2>
    
    <h3>20 year old, Female, College Student, Accounting Major</h3><br>
    
    <h2><u>Tasks</u></h2>
    
    <h3>Register for a new account</h3>
    <p>User was quick to find the link to click for registering a new account as it is written clearly on the login page.</p>
    <p>Upon clicking, the user found the form very easy to fill out as there were labels for everything.</p>
    <p>No successful registration message, just goes back to login page.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Login to the site with your new account</h3>
    <p>User was already sent back to the login page, so she easily was able to fill out the form to login and successfully login.</p>
    <p>After logging in, got sent right to home page of the app.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Search for books by George Orwell</h3>
    <p>User saw the drop down next to the search bar and immediately knew that was the search type, so she selected Author to search by author.</p>
    <p>Then easily filled out the form to search by typing in "George Orwell" and the results came up successfully.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Add 3 books to your favorites</h3>
    <p>User was hesitant as there is nothing on the screen that explicitly says "Add to favorites".</p>
    <p>Guessed that you have to click on a book to add it to favorites, and when she clicked a popup came up and that's where she found out how to add to favorites.</p>
    <p>User was greeted kindly with a success message after adding to favorites, and easily repeated this 2 more times.</p><br>
    
    <h3>View your favorites and delete one</h3>
    <p>There is no favorites tab, only a "My Collection" tab, so the user was a bit confused at first.</p>
    <p>The user assumed that "My Collection" contained favorites, so she clicked that and successfully went to view her favorites.</p>
    <p>User felt that the list was a bit unorganized since there is no visual separation between book information.</p>
    <p>User easily removed a book from favorites by clicking the "Remove from favorites" button, but felt it wasn't the easiest to tell which book she was deleting.</p>
    <p>User liked that there was a warning asking if you are sure you want to delete the book, and that there was a success message.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Log out of the app</h3>
    <p>User assumed from past experience that the logout button might be in the top right, which it was.</p>
    <p>User then easily clicked on the logout link and it logged her out successfully.</p><br>
    
    <h2><u>Improvements</u></h2>
    
    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>Changed wording from "My Collection" to "My Favorites"</p>
    <p>Added lines between books on favorites list</p>
	<p>Added text on the homepage with some guidance on how to use the app</p>
	<p>Added an underline to forgot password and register here so you know where to click/know what's clickable</p><br>
	
	<h3>Stylistic</h3>
	<p>Styling choice just wanted to make all the buttons match</p>
