            About the Game
        </h2>
        <p>
            Minecraft is an open world 3D sandbox game that was released in 2009. It's a world made of blocks where the only limit is your imagination. The game takes on an old fashioned look,
            using 16-bit textures reminiscent of a Super Nintendo game. The title explains the game pretty well, as you mine and also craft. You are placed in this world and you gather resources, 
            craft tools, fight off monsters, and build whatever you want.

        <h2>My Experience with Minecraft</h2>
        <p>
            I have played Minecraft for most of my life and I can say that it has always been my favorite game.
            I may not play it all the time like I used to, but I always find myself coming back to the game every so often,
            and reliving those good ol' days again. Usually these random spurts of getting back into Minecraft only last
            a couple of weeks, but I have lots of fun in the short time that I have back in the magical cube world.
